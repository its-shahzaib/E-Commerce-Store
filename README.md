# E-Commerce-Store
This project focuses on building a simple and user-friendly E-Commerce Online Store where customers can register, log in, view products, add them to the cart, and place orders.  The project uses MySQL for the database, HTML/CSS/JS for the front-end, and PHP for server-side operations.
